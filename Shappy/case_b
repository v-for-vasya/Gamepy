1,000 different subgames with v(1)=Aaron ... v(1000)=Zwigli

Subgame with Aaron (v(1)) being the charitable park contributor:
  v(1)=1002 // Aaron contributes by himself
  v(2...n)=1000 // other players not interested in helping on park
  v(1,2 ... n-1) = 1000*n // all subcoalitions except for grand coalition
  v(1,2,...n) = 1002*1000  // grand coalition of all getting $2 from Aaron's work while everyone else was leeching off.

Subgame with Abraham (v(1)) being the charitable park contributor:
  v(2)=1002 // Abraham contributes by himself
  v(1,3...n)=1000 // other players not interested in helping on park
  v(1,3 ... n-1) = 1000*n // all subcoalitions except for grand coalition
  v(1,3,...n) = 1002*1000  // grand coalition of all getting $2 from Abraham's work while everyone else was leeching off.

Same thing for all 998 subgames. In each one of these games it appears to be a good idea for each individual person to contribute,
but once we put it all together:

Big game case B where all would like to contribute:
  v(1...n)=1002
  v(1,...,500)=v(1,...,501)=v(1,...,1000) // You only need 500 people to improve the park.
  //People are indifferent. No incentive to form coalitions
  
Big game case B with dictator:
  v(1...n)=500 // 1000-500=500 dictator takes away 500 for everyone who's alone and not working on the park
  v(1,...,500)=v(1,...,501)=v(1,...,1000) // You only need 500 people to improve the park. Being alone carries a 500 punishment.
  //Best to join a coalition with 500 players
